## Web Analytics
Web analytics is the measurement, collection, analysis, and reporting of web data to understand and optimize web usage.
Web analytics applications can also help companies measure the results of traditional print or broadcast advertising campaigns. It can be used to estimate how traffic to a website changes after launching a new advertising campaign. Web analytics provides information about the number of visitors to a website and the number of page views, or create user behavior profiles.[2] It helps gauge traffic and popularity trends, which is useful for market research.
